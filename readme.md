Instance Lockout Timers
===

This addon for 1.12 vanilla wow clients tracks your 5 instance lockouts for you.  

Check your current lockouts with either  
```
/instancetimers
/its
```

A limitation of the 1.12 client is that you can't know if your instance entrance is fresh. If you die and have to run back inside a new timer will be formed. In this case you may remove it with the follow commands, which all do the same thing.  
```
/ts del
/ts delete
/its rem
/its remove
```
